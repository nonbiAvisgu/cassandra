Autodesk Inventor 2011 is not just a 3D modeling software, but also a comprehensive design solution that includes various features and functions for different engineering disciplines. Some of the highlights of Autodesk Inventor 2011 are:

- iLogic: A design automation tool that lets you create rules and parameters to control your designs and automate common tasks. You can use iLogic to create custom configurations of your products, validate design options, and generate documentation.
- iCopy: A tool that lets you copy and place standard components in your assemblies, such as bolts, nuts, washers, and pins. You can also use iCopy to create multiple instances of complex assemblies, such as gears, valves, and pumps. iCopy automatically adjusts the size and position of the components based on the constraints you specify.
- Realistic rendering: A visualization tool that lets you create stunning images and animations of your designs with realistic materials, lighting, and shadows. You can use realistic rendering to showcase your designs to clients, stakeholders, and colleagues.
- DWG compatibility: A feature that lets you work seamlessly with AutoCAD files and users. You can import and export DWG files without losing any data or fidelity. You can also use DWG TrueView to view and print DWG files without installing AutoCAD.
- BIM interoperability: A feature that lets you participate in building information modeling (BIM) projects with Revit users. You can use BIM Exchange to export your designs to a BIM-ready Revit format with authoring metadata. You can also use architectural view scales to create drawings that match the Revit scales.
- Simulation: A feature that lets you test and optimize your designs for performance, stress, motion, and safety. You can use frame analysis to analyze structural frames for static and dynamic loads. You can also use simulation guide to follow a step-by-step workflow for setting up and running simulations.
- Tooling: A feature that lets you design molds, dies, and other tooling for plastic parts. You can use tooling to create core and cavity models from plastic part models. You can also use unique instance support to manage different versions of tooling components.

With Autodesk Inventor 2011, you can create innovative designs faster and easier than ever before. Whether you are a beginner or an expert, Autodesk Inventor 2011 has the tools and capabilities you need to turn your ideas into reality.
