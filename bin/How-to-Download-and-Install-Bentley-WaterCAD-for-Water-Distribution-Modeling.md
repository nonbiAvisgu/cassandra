Congratulations! You have successfully downloaded and installed Bentley WaterCAD on your computer. You can now start modeling and analyzing your water distribution systems using this powerful software.
  
Bentley WaterCAD is a subset of Bentley WaterGEMS, which offers more advanced features and capabilities for water distribution modeling. You can use Bentley WaterCAD from within MicroStation, AutoCAD, or as a stand-alone application, for additional flexibility. You can also integrate Bentley WaterCAD with Bentley WaterSight, a digital twin solution that unifies disparate data sources to provide you with a smarter, more resilient, and sustainable water system.
 
With Bentley WaterCAD, you can easily perform various analyses and simulations on your water distribution systems, such as:

- What-if scenario management: You can analyze your existing water distribution system and predict how it will react in the future under different conditions and demands.
- Reduce energy expenses: You can compare different pump strategies and select the most cost-effective option for your system.
- Analyze pipe and valve criticality: You can discover the weakest links in your water distribution systems and evaluate the adequacy of isolation valves.
- Easily analyze water quality: You can determine water age, water source, analyze chlorine decay or perform multispecies analysis with just a few clicks.
- Find available fire flow at hydrants: You can quickly determine if your system provides adequate fire protection at any node.

Bentley WaterCAD is trusted by thousands of engineers and utilities around the world for their water distribution modeling needs. Some of the successful projects that used Bentley WaterCAD include:

- Enorsul used Bentley WaterCAD to evaluate the improvement proposals for the Olinda supply system in Brazil, which will benefit over 250,000 inhabitants, workers, and visitors in the region.
- NJS Engineers India used Bentley WaterCAD to design an efficient water supply network for a 13-village region in India, reducing design time by 15% and saving more than USD 12 million in costs.
- WaterGEMS helped AKATT design and optimize a water distribution network to improve living conditions for 200,000 people in Burkina Faso's second largest city.
