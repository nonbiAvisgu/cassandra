## Audio Quality
 
BeatKangz Virtual Beat Thang Pro VSTi offers CD quality 16bit / 44.1kHz sampling, playback and export. It has 16 tracks with playable mute and solo functions so you can create patterns that can be performed and remixed on the fly. You can also export your songs and loops as .wav or .aiff files for easy import to your DAW of choice[^1^].
 
## Controller Options
 
You can trigger sounds and functions using your computer keyboard, or any compatible MIDI controller. You can also integrate the software seamlessly with the Beat Thang hardware if you have one[^1^]. The software has a one octave pad layout with 8 banks so you can bang out beats or play the keys over 8 octaves. Each pad has 16 layers of velocity sensitivity for emotive performance. You can also solo and mute individual pads for added remix control[^1^].
 
## Effects
 
The software comes with a variety of effects that you can apply to your sounds, such as filters, delays, reverb, chorus, disintegrator, overdrive, distortion, phaser, chorus/flanger, pitch shifter, vibrato and vinyl effect. You can also add some bang to your tracks with the onboard mastering feature[^1^].
 
## Sequencing
 
The software has a user-friendly real-time sequencer that lets you create patterns in real time using quantize, swing, individual bar lengths and tap tempo. You can then string them together in song mode to create full compositions. You can also use step sequencing if you prefer[^1^]. The software has no load time when you switch beats and kits, which makes it fast and efficient[^2^].
 
## Sampling
 
You can record your own samples directly into the software using your computer's built-in mic or line input. You can also import .wav or .aiff files to use as loops or samples[^1^]. The software has a clear waveform view that lets you edit your samples easily. You can edit start and end points, normalize, reverse and resample your sounds. You can also use the auto chop feature to quickly create mash up parts and custom kits from your samples[^1^]. If you have some vinyl records lying around, you can also use them as sources for sampling[^2^].
 
## File System
 
The software has an easy to browse file system that syncs with the Beat Thang hardware. You can access thousands of sounds that are organized by category and subcategory. You can also create your own folders and subfolders to store your custom sounds[^1^]. The software comes with 3,234 high quality professionally mastered sounds that cover various genres and styles[^3^].
