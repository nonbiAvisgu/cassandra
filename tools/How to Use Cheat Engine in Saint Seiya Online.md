But what if you want to have an edge over other players, or just have some fun with the game mechanics? That's where Cheat Engine comes in. Cheat Engine is a free software that allows you to modify the memory of any game or application running on your computer. You can use it to change values such as health, cheat engine, 7th sense gauge, combo multiplier, throw count, and more. You can also use it to activate scripts that can give you infinite resources, invincibility, speed hack, and other cheats.
 
However, using Cheat Engine in Saint Seiya Online is not without risks. The game has an anti-cheat system that can detect any abnormal activity and ban your account. Therefore, you should use Cheat Engine at your own discretion and responsibility. We are not responsible for any consequences that may arise from using Cheat Engine in Saint Seiya Online.

3. Open Cheat Engine and click on the computer icon on the top left corner.
4. Select SaintSeiyaOnline.exe from the process list and click Open.
