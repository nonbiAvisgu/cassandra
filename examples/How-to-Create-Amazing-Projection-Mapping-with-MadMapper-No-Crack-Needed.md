But how do you create projection mapping? What software do you need? And how do you avoid using illegal cracks that can harm your computer and expose you to legal risks?
  
In this article, we will show you how to create projection mapping using MadMapper, a powerful and easy-to-use software that lets you map any media onto any surface. We will also show you how to get MadMapper legally and affordably, without using any cracks or hacks.
  
## What is MadMapper?
  
MadMapper is a software that allows you to map any media (images, videos, animations, etc.) onto any surface (walls, buildings, objects, etc.). You can use MadMapper to create projection mapping for any purpose, such as:
  
- Art installations and exhibitions
- Live performances and concerts
- Theatre and dance shows
- Advertising and branding
- Events and parties
- Educational and cultural projects

MadMapper is compatible with Mac and Windows computers, and supports various input sources, such as cameras, webcams, Syphon/Spout, NDI, Art-Net/DMX, MIDI, OSC, etc. You can also use MadMapper with other software and hardware devices, such as Resolume, Modul8, VDMX, Ableton Live, TouchDesigner, Arduino, Kinect, etc.
  
MadMapper is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive. You can easily import and edit your media files, adjust the brightness, contrast, color, opacity, etc., and map them onto any surface using quads (rectangles), masks (shapes), or meshes (grids). You can also create scenes and cues to organize your media files and switch between them smoothly.
  
## How to Create Projection Mapping with MadMapper?
  
To create projection mapping with MadMapper, you need three things:

1. A computer with MadMapper installed
2. A projector connected to your computer
3. A surface to project onto

Once you have these three things ready, you can follow these steps to create projection mapping with MadMapper:

1. Launch MadMapper and create a new project.
2. Import your media files into the Media Library. You can drag and drop them from your computer or use the Import button.
3. Select a media file from the Media Library and drag it onto the Input View. This will create an input quad that represents your media file.
4. Select the input quad and drag it onto the Output View. This will create an output quad that represents your projection area.
5. Adjust the size and position of the output quad to fit your surface. You can use the handles on the corners and edges of the output quad to resize and rotate it. You can also use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move it pixel by pixel.
6. If your surface is not rectangular or has some obstacles on it, you can use masks or meshes to shape your output quad. To create a mask, click on the Mask button on the toolbar and draw a shape on the Output View. To create a mesh, click on the Mesh button on the toolbar and draw a grid on the Output View. You can then edit the vertices of the mask or mesh to match your surface.
7. If you want to add more media files to your projection mapping, repeat steps 3 to 6 for each media file. You can layer multiple output quads on top of each other and change their order using the Layer panel.
8. If you want to create scenes and cues for your projection mapping, click on the Scene Editor button on the toolbar. This will open a new window where you can create scenes by selecting output quads from the Output View. You can then create cues by selecting scenes from the Scene Editor. You can also add transitions and effects to your cues using the Cue Editor panel.
9. To preview your projection mapping on your surface, click on the Fullscreen button on the toolbar 0f148eb4a0
