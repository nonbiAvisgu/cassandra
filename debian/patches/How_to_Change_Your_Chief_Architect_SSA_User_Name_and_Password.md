Changing your SSA user name and password is a good practice to keep your account secure and prevent unauthorized access. You should also choose a strong password that is not easy to guess or crack. A strong password should have at least 8 characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. You should also avoid using common words, names, dates, or personal information that can be easily found online or guessed by someone who knows you.
 
Another way to protect your account is to enable two-factor authentication (2FA), which adds an extra layer of security to your sign-in process. With 2FA, you will need to enter a verification code that is sent to your phone or email address every time you sign in to your account. This way, even if someone knows your SSA user name and password, they will not be able to access your account without the verification code. To enable 2FA for your account, follow these steps:

1. Go to the "My Account" page and click on the "Security" tab.
2. Click on the "Enable Two-Factor Authentication" button.
3. Choose whether you want to receive the verification code by text message or email and enter your phone number or email address accordingly.
4. Click on the "Send Code" button and enter the code that you receive in the field provided.
5. Click on the "Verify" button and confirm that you want to enable 2FA for your account.

You will see a confirmation message that 2FA has been enabled for your account. You can also disable 2FA at any time by following the same steps and clicking on the "Disable Two-Factor Authentication" button.
